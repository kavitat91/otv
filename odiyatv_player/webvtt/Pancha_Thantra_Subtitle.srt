1
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,760
<b>In a dense forest
lived a notorious Lion...</b>

2
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:28,120
<b>...who hunted all the animals
which came in his sight.</b>

3
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:31,560
<b>He hunted the animals...</b>

4
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:33,360
<b>...not only for his meal...</b>

5
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:35,000
<b>...but for fun too.</b>

6
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:38,760
<b>So day by day...</b>

7
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:42,280
<b>...the animal count in the forest
began to drop.</b>

8
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:50,480
<b>All the animals were worried.</b>

9
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:53,600
<b>One day, all the animals...</b>

10
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:56,880
<b>...gathered under a big banyan tree
for a meeting.</b>

11
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:01,920
<b>Everyday we are losing many animals.</b>

12
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:06,440
<b>You know it dragged
my uncle yesterday.</b>

13
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:18,880
<b>Last week it seized my two kids
who were playing outside my house.</b>

14
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:24,360
<b>My wife too was.</b>

15
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:26,760
<b>My wife too was.</b>

16
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:31,520
<b>He tied my brother around it's
waist and went away.</b>

17
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:34,280
<b>If this continues like this...</b>

18
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:39,160
<b>...in due course none of us would
be alive or exist in this forest.</b>

19
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:41,720
<b>We need to stop this.</b>

20
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:47,760
<b>Brother, please why don’t you
suggest an idea to stop this?</b>

21
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:51,720
<b>I am just thinking on it.</b>

22
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:57,040
<b>All of them remained silent
for some time.</b>

23
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:02,680
<b>Listen to me carefully.</b>

24
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:08,760
<b>Let’s take turns and send
one each from a family.</b>

25
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:15,200
<b>The Lion will eat where it stays.</b>

26
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:18,480
<b>As time passes
he would forget to hunt...</b>

27
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:21,480
<b>...and hence we can live
without worrying...</b>

28
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:23,640
<b>...when we would be likely killed.</b>

29
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:25,520
<b>It sounds good.</b>

30
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:27,760
<b>We should tell this plan to the Lion.</b>

31
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:31,480
<b>Oh, God!
Who would say this to him?</b>

32
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:34,280
<b>Hey, brother Fox.</b>

33
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:36,960
<b>You say this to him, please.</b>

34
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:39,880
<b>I need to do this too.</b>

35
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:42,960
<b>Ok, I will do it. But one thing...</b>

36
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:46,520
<b>...everyone should accompany me
when I meet him.</b>

37
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:53,640
<b>Next day all the animals
went near the Lion’s cave.</b>

38
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:59,720
<b>The Lion, on seeing them together,
exclaimed!</b>

39
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:02,640
<b>Aah...ha! My good time.</b>

40
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:05,920
<b>It looks as though time is by my side.</b>

41
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:08,560
<b>Whom do I pick first?</b>

42
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:13,480
<b>The Fox slowly stepped forward...</b>

43
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:15,280
<b>...and explained their plan.</b>

44
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:17,640
<b>The rest were waiting eagerly...</b>

45
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:19,880
<b>...to hear the Lion’s decision.</b>

46
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:22,640
<b>Your plan sounds good.</b>

47
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:23,840
<b>Okay.</b>

48
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:28,160
<b>I would not kill anybody
but for the one you send.</b>

49
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:32,560
<b>One thing you should remember.</b>

50
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:39,120
<b>My prey needs to be in my cave
everyday morning by 10 o’clock.</b>

51
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:40,760
<b>If not...</b>

52
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:58,960
<b>From that day, every day...</b>

53
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:01,960
<b>...one animal went into the
Lion’s cave.</b>

54
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:21,800
<b>Aah...ha!</b>

55
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:25,920
<b>What a lovely and luxurious life!</b>

56
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:30,840
<b>Months rolled on.</b>

57
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:34,360
<b>It was the turn of a Hare.</b>

58
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:37,760
<b>The Hare woke up in the morning.</b>

59
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:41,720
<b>What do I do now?
Today it’s my turn.</b>

60
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:43,160
<b>For my folk’s sake...</b>

61
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:45,560
<b>...I need to be the Lion’s prey today.</b>

62
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,120
<b>But still, the Hare...</b>

63
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:52,560
<b>...somehow wanted to escape
from the Lion’s hand.</b>

64
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:54,520
<b>Thinking deep...</b>

65
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:58,160
<b>...the Rabbit moved towards
the cave’s direction.</b>

66
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:00,400
<b>After crossing some distance...</b>

67
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:03,040
<b>I feel thirsty. I want water.</b>

68
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,000
<b>Where do I get from?</b>

69
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:12,920
<b>He looked around in search of water...</b>

70
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:16,560
<b>...and found a well
in a little distance.</b>

71
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:22,640
<b>The Hare came close to the well
and peeped inside.</b>

72
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,800
<b>Aah! I have got an idea!</b>

73
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:30,280
<b>Now I can play the trick
and will handle the Lion.</b>

74
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:35,120
<b>At the same time...</b>

75
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:37,520
<b>...the Lion was waiting for his meal.</b>

76
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:56,040
<b>These animals,
what guts they have!</b>

77
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:58,960
<b>My prey has not arrived so...</b>

78
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:01,120
<b>Please! Please help!</b>

79
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:02,840
<b>Please help! Somebody help!</b>

80
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:09,800
<b>Who, who?
Who is chasing you?</b>

81
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:13,400
<b>We five of us
were sake as your prey...</b>

82
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:15,800
<b>...but while coming,
all of a sudden...</b>

83
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:19,640
<b>...a lion jumped from a ditch
and started to chase us.</b>

84
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:23,080
<b>Four of them fell prey
and I just escaped.</b>

85
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:24,400
<b>What?</b>

86
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:27,960
<b>Another lion challenging me
in this forest?</b>

87
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:31,720
<b>I will just finish him right now.</b>

88
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:35,400
<b>Come with me.
Show me where is he?</b>

89
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:38,600
<b>The Hare took him to the well.</b>

90
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:53,400
<b>Uh...</b>

91
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:55,720
<b>He is there! There!
Down there!</b>

92
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:58,680
<b>The Lion peeped in to see.</b>

93
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:01,720
<b>He saw his own shadow.</b>

94
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,880
<b>The Lion thought it
to be another lion.</b>

95
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:06,560
<b>Who are you?</b>

96
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:10,600
<b>Who are you...?</b>

97
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:15,280
<b>How dare he talks back to me?</b>

98
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:17,960
<b>Come out, if you have the guts.</b>

99
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:20,600
<b>Come out, if you have the guts...</b>

100
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:23,520
<b>It's high time I finished him off.</b>

101
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:30,120
<b>Roaring
he jumped into the well.</b>

102
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,760
<b>Not knowing how to swim...</b>

103
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:40,640
<b>...the Lion drowned.</b>

104
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:44,560
<b>On hearing the Lion’s death...</b>

105
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:48,080
<b>...all the animals
celebrated the occasion.</b>
